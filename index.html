                <p>Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

                    This problem was asked by Wayfair.
                    
                    You are given a 2 x N board, and instructed to completely cover the board with the following shapes:
                    
                    Dominoes, or 2 x 1 rectangles.
                    Trominoes, or L-shapes.
                    For example, if N = 4, here is one possible configuration, where A is a domino, and B and C are trominoes.
                    
                    A B B C
                    A B C C

                    Given an integer N, determine in how many ways this task is possible.
